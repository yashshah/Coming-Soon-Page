      <p>There are some people in your life that will own a piece of your heart forever whether they realize it or not.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched – they must be felt with the heart.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Love doesn't make the world go round. Love is what makes the ride worthwhile.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>I like to believe that love is a reciprocal thing, that it can't really be felt, truly, by one.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>The heart wants what it wants. There's no logic to these things. You meet someone and you fall in love and that's that.</p>
    </blockquote>
